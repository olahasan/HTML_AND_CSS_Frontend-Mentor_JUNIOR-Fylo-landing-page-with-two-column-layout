## Overview

### The challenge

This project is great if you're starting to get confident with slightly more complex layouts. The second section with the testimonial area will provide a nice challenge.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive layout. I also practiced using CSS custom properties for maintaining a consistent color scheme and improved my understanding of responsive design with media queries.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on improving accessibility by using more semantic HTML tags and adding ARIA labels where necessary. I also aim to further optimize my CSS by grouping similar styles together.
